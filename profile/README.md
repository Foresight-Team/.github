**Welcome to the homepage of Team Foresight**

Team foresight is comprised of two partners: Nathan, and Monika.

Nathan had the idea, one day, to make a horror-based Visual Novel.  
He wrote an outline of the game and part of the first act, and showed it to Monika.  
She made some changes, suggestions, and additions.  
A month or so later, Nathan started gathering people to form a team to work on the game.  

The first person he asked, was Monika, who accepted without hesitation.  
She quickly became an integral part of the team, and it's continued existence.

Second to join, was JC, who offered to act in a music composer/engineer capacity.  
This made him the third music-based member of the group.

With 2 writers, and 3 musicians, the team was created.  
The basis of Nathan's game, was all around the use of the third eye, which often is in conjunction with foresight.  
To this, Nathan called the team "Team Foresight"
