**Welcome to the homepage of Team Foresight**

Team foresight is comprised of two partners: Nathan, and Monika.

Nathan had the idea, one day, to make a Visual Novel, and asked Monika if she wanted to help.

She accepted, and the rest is history.

**The people and their roles**

**Nathan**
CEO, head writer, coder, musician, and designer.

**Monika**
2ic, writer, musician, and designer

At the moment, due to each of us having our own ongoing projects/commitments, there is no way to estimate a time of completion.
So we ask that you be patient, and let us work.
